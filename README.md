## How It Works

1. **Select Subject**: Choose from Math, Physics, Chemistry, or General Science
2. **Draw Your Problem**: Use the drawing canvas to sketch equations, diagrams, or problems
3. **AI Analysis**: Our AI analyzes your drawing and identifies the problem type
4. **Smart Solutions**: Get step-by-step solutions with proper variable handling
5. **Variable Management**: Assign and reuse variables across multiple problems

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Drawing**: HTML5 Canvas with color support
- **Math Rendering**: MathJax for LaTeX display
